# Credit-Risk-Modelling

Credit risk refers to the chance that a borrower will be unable to make their payments on time and default on their debt. It refers to the risk that a lender may not receive their interest due or the principal lent on time.

Objective
The objective of this project is to predict the probability of default on a given obligation, in this case, credit cards. This will allow the generation of strategies that minimize the risk of deterioration of the client's financial health.

Approach
Data preparation and Pre-processing
Checking missing values
Outliers removal
Encoding concept
Feature Engineering and Selection
features selection
Scaling the features
Balancing the data
Model Development and Model Evaluation
Logistic regression
Random Forest
Xgboost
Hyperparameter tuning
Cross validation
Dependencies
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
XGBOOST
seaborn
pyhthon 3.9

Conclusion:
We have built the credit risk model by using python. we have tried with different machine learning algorithms ie. Logistic regression, Random Forest, and Xgboost classifier. we have also done hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. The final accuracy of the model we achieved was 82%.
